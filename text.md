[Project](project)

Imagine your job is to build tools and instruments for researchers studying
animals.

A researcher tells you she wants to play tones to train animals.

This is a very vague project description so far, but you know that people
generally use the word 'tone' in this sense to mean a steady periodic sound at a
single frequency and that this researcher wants to teach animals to perform some
behavior after they hear one of these tones.
