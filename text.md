[Project](project)

Imagine your job is to build tools and instruments for researchers studying
animals.

A researcher tells you she wants to play tones to train animals. Can you help
her?

This is a very vague project description so far, but you know that people
generally use the word 'tone' in this sense to mean a sound of a single
frequency and that this researcher wants to teach animals to perform some
behavior after they hear one of these tones.

Some problems are so challenging it can be difficult to find any solution.

Sometimes the specifications push the limits of what has been done before so
entirely new approaches are necessary.

Other problems have so many potential solutions it can be difficult to chose
one.

Sometimes the specifications are well within the limits of what has been done
before so there are many ways to do what you want so you need some way of
selecting one for your situation.

[Project Questions](project-questions)

What is the range of the tone frequencies?

Some animals have much better hearing than humans.

Lots of sound equipment exists for producing sounds humans can hear.

Less equipment exists for producing ultrasonic so that could make the project
more technically challenging.

The researcher tells you that ultrasonic tones are unnecessary, tones from 1kHz
to 15kHz are acceptable.

How pure of a tone is necessary?

Perhaps if the researcher was looking at the brain response to the tone it could
be important that it only contain a single frequency.

The researcher tells you that the done does not need to be completely pure, but
it must be repeatable and distinct enough so that multiple tones can be
distinguished.
