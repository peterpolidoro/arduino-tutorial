# [](#header-1) Operating System?

The software that supports a computer's basic functions, such as scheduling
tasks, executing applications, and controlling peripherals.

Enables the use of lots of prewritten, well-tested, software libraries.

Adds convenience, but also overhead.

Needs to be configured and maintained, needs time to boot up and shut down.

Not real-time. Operating system interrupts can affect timing.
